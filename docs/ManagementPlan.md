<!-- Introduction -->
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<h3>1.1 Project Overview</h3>
<p>MuSpace is a music-based social media platform focused on connecting music fans with one another and allowing them to share their tastes with the world. Each MuSpace user will be provided with a personal feed to post about songs, albums, artists, and playlists that they are interested in. Users will be able to add friends on MuSpace and look at their detailed Spotify listening history. Users will also be able to view detailed statistics about their listening habits, such as listening time, favourite genres, favourite artists, and more.</p>

<!-- 3. Managerial Process -->
<h2>3. Managerial Process</h2>
<h3>3.1 Management Objectives and Priorities</h3>
<p>The main objective of this project is to develop a web-based music application that will eventually branch out to Android and iOS. This uses the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/" target="_blank">Spotify API</a> and <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/#about-the-sdk" target="_blank">Spotify SDK</a> to connect people listening to similar styles of music. By the end of the term (August, 5th 2021), our goal is to have all project deliverables (the SRS, the SPMP, analysis, document, design documentation, back-end implementation, front-end implementation, and user documentation) complete. By then our goal is to also have a complete well-implemented version of our application, which would be heavily Quality Tested. This project's major priority is to have an easy-to-understand, easy-to-read, consistent, and informative set of documentation as well as a seamless project flow. Since the project has no monetary funding, the completion of deliverables is solely dependent on our time and resources. </p>
<h3>3.2 Monitoring and Controlling Mechanisms</h3>
<p>Our group meetings take place every Tuesday and Thursday during lectures, where we send one person to listen to the lecture, in this case, Jagveer. During this time, we split into groups for sprints, where work ethic is peer-checked.</p>
<p>All calls are done via <a href="https://discord.com/" target="_blank">Discord</a> (as in a person is not applicable), Documentation is done on <a href="https://www.google.ca/docs/about/" target="_blank">Google Docs</a> and then transferred onto our project webpage. The UI is designed on <a href="https://www.figma.com/" target="_blank">Figma</a>. The Github project is our team's central repository for code and resources</p>
<p>SQA is conducted when sprints are done. The process is conducted by those not in the sprint to ensure that quality control is unbiased.</p>
<h3>3.3 Risk Management / User Privacy / User Safety</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        <b>Risk:</b> Too many users attempting to connect to the website/application. This can overload any of our back-end components by creating too many concurrent requests and crashing.<br>
        <b>Solution:</b> Access to the site will be throttled by Buttflare - Buttflare is a DNS service that also provides DDOS mitigation. Buttflare limits the number of people that can concurrently access the website.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        <b>Risk:</b> Someone who programs a bot to sign up as a user on the platform and send spam messages/harasses to others, overload the system by sending too many requests, or automate certain tasks.<br>
        <b>Solution:</b> All account creation, user sign-in and important actions will be verified using Google reCaptcha v2 to assure that the user is indeed human and not a bot. See Risk 4 for the answer for spam messages.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        <b>Risk:</b> An account sends too many chat messages in a certain amount of time (spam).<br>
        <b>Solution:</b> All messages will be rate-limited site-wide to about 5 messages per second.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        <b>Risk:</b> The application is offline due to maintenance, traffic, or other uncertain factors.<br>
        <b>Solution:</b> A page will be displayed for the duration of the offline activity that explains to the user why the application is offline, and how long it’ll take to get back online.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        <b>Risk:</b> A new component added to the codebase could make another previous component unstable.<br>
        <b>Solution:</b> Anytime a new feature or piece of code is added, we perform adequate testing. 
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        <b>Risk:</b> Spotify or any fundamental API or resource that we are using changes their terms of services or copyright laws.<br>
        <b>Solution:</b> A substitute can be searched for when this happens - no other solution exists for this type of risk.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        <b>Risk:</b> A user experiences harassment, hate, or anything negative.<br>
        <b>Solution:</b> The user can report another user by going onto their profile, This feedback is then stored in the database. The developers will be checking reports often.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        <b>Risk:</b> Data not being securely sent over the internet to the MuSpace server.<br>
        <b>Solution:</b> All data will be securely transferred from a client to the server with Google Firebase’s implementation of data privacy and security. All endpoints used on Firebase are secured through Google’s servers. See <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/overview" target="_blank">here</a> for more information on how Google Firebase uses security.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        <b>Risk:</b> Another person hacks into your account.<br>
        <b>Solution:</b> We will use OAuth2 to make sure that the person is who they say they are. See <a href="https://oauth.net/2/" target="_blank">here</a> for more information on how OAuth2 uses security.

<h3>4.1.1 Feature Specific Requirements</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Login Page:</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>A page that displays a form where a user can type their username and password.</li>
        <li>Will contain a <i>reCaptcha</i> that a user has to pass.</li>
        <li>The user will then press the submit button to login.</li>
        <li>The data from the form will be sent to <i>Firebase Authentication</i> - this will return a success or failure message that will then be displayed to the user.</li>
        <li>If the user is successful in logging in, they will be redirected to their home page.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Account Creation:</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>The first page of the account creation process requires the user to input their email address, username, full name, and password. These will be a part of a form, where the username and full name field are plaintexts, the password field is a password field, and the email address field is an email address field.</li>
<!--         <li>The password will need to be entered twice for verification.</li> -->
        <li>This data will then be verified to make sure it meets certain criteria. These criteria are as follows: </li>
        <ul>
            <li>The username must be a minimum of 5 characters and a maximum of 32 characters.</li>
            <li>The email address must be in a regular email address format.</li>
            <li>The password must be a minimum of six characters. </li>
            <li>The full name has no restrictions as there are too many variations.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>After all these factors have been verified, they will be sent to <i>Google Authentication</i> to be stored.</li>
        <li>The second part of the process in creating an account will be clicking on a link in your email address that verifies that you are registering with your email address. This link will then take you to the next page.</li>
        <li>The next page of the account creation involves linking your <i>MuSpace</i> account to your <i>Spotify</i> account. This page consists of a single button that uses <i>Spotify’s OAuth2</i> implementation of account permissions to allow you to give permission to <i>Spotify</i> to give the user’s account information to <i>MuSpace</i>. This process will open in a new webpage that is managed by <i>Spotify</i>.</li>
        <li>Once the user has linked their <i>Spotify</i> account, they will be redirected to the user’s home page.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Home Page:</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>All pages of the application will have a sidebar on the left side of the page that allows you to navigate through all the main component pages of <i>MuSpace</i>.</li>
        <li>The home page is the central component of the user experience.</li>
        <li>The home page includes basic user information such as the most-streamed music that day and recently listened to songs.</li>
        <li>It also displays the user’s friend’s top albums and listening activity. There’s a section that also displays popular public listening rooms that the user may be interested in joining.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>User Profile:</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>The user profile will use user data compiled by <i>MuSpace</i>. These stats will constantly be updated by retrieving and recompiling data on a user from the Spotify API and processing it to tailor it towards the features of <i>MuSpace</i>.</li>
        <li>Shows recent listening history from <i>Spotify</i>. </li>
        <li>Will display basic user information, such as username, which will be retrieved from the Firestore database.</li>
        <li>The user profile page will display other generated statistics that are dependent on the specific user’s listening habits.</li>
        <li>A request is sent to the Firestore database, which will then return a list of data to be displayed.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Friends Page:</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>The Friends page will list all the user’s friends.</li>
<!--         <li>On the Friends page, there will be a button to add a new friend by username.</li> -->
        <li>On the Friends page, clicking/tapping on a friend's name will present the user with options to send a private message, or unfriend the selected user.</li>
        <li>A request is sent to the Firestore database, which will then return a list of chat room IDs that the user is a part of. The client can then request each chat room specifically, which the database will return.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Messaging Page:</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>The Messaging page shows a list of all ongoing chat with friends</li>
        <li>These rooms are React components, which can individually be clicked on.</li>
        <li>Users will be able to select a conversation that will open it in a bigger component which will display the chats between all users, alongside their names and profile pictures. Any messages sent will be sent to the <i>Firestore</i> database, which will then be sent to all other users’ clients.</li>
        <li>Users will also be able to delete conversations. Deleting the conversation will remove it from the Messaging page and also remove the user from the list of users participating in the said chat room.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>4.2.1 Software Requirements Specification (SRS)</h3>
<p>Up to date <a href="https://sherrao.github.io/MuSpace/Requirements.html">SRS Documentation</a>.</p>
<h3>4.2.2 Software Design Description (SDD)</h3>
<p>We will be using <i>JavaScript</i>, <i>TypeScript</i>, <i>CSS</i>, and <i>HTML</i> as the languages for the project. These languages are the easiest to implement for a web application of this magnitude which requires the front-end and back-end to work with each other seamlessly. Without the hassle of separate code bases for both. <i>JavaScript</i> and <i>TypeScript</i> are also ideal languages that have a great capability of handling asynchronous server-side requests.</p>
<p>We will be using <i>ReactJS</i>, <i>StyledComponents</i>, and <i>Semantic UI</i> to create the front-end of the application - this is the code that will be executed and displayed client-side using a built-in browser <i>JavaScript</i> engine, such as <i>Google’s V8 JavaScript Engine</i>.</p>
<p>For the back-end of the application, we are using <i>Node.js</i> to run a headless <i>Chromium</i> instance to execute server-side code. The back-end will integrate the <i>Spotify SDK Spotify API</i> to draw all user data - artists, albums, genres, and songs that the artist listens to. The API can also extract music listening and other statistics. This data will be used to connect with other users using a scoring system and to discover new music. The <i>Spotify Web SDK</i> will be used to play music using the user's <i>Spotify</i> account in the web app. The <i>SDK</i> requires the users to have a <i>Spotify</i> account.</p>
<p>The other portion of the back-end uses <i>Google’s</i> suite of APIs included in <i>Google Firebase</i>. These are but are not limited to Firestore and Authentication. Firestore will be used to store a lot of data:</p>
<ul>
    <li>User data</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Login Information</li>
        <li>Selected <i>Spotify</i> Information</li>
        <li>Personal Data (Name, Age, Country, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Connections between users</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Date of connection</li>
        <li>Users involved</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Chat/Messages Rooms</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Chat room ID</li>
        <li>Chat messages</li>
        <li>Room participants</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>The code styling and conventions have been outlined in this <a href="https://sherrao.github.io/MuSpace/Conventions.html">Github document</a>.</p>
<h3>4.2.3 Software Test Plan</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Unit Testing</li>
    <ul>
        <li>All major functions and components of the project will be tested using <a href="https://jestjs.io/" target="_blank"><i>Jest</i></a>. This testing framework allows the ease of writing unit tests.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Functional Testing</li>
    <ul>
        <li>We will be using the <a href="https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/" target="_blank"><i>React Testing Library</i></a> and <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/" target="_blank"><i>Selenium WebDriver</i></a>. This allows a lot of automation with testing visual components and ensuring the application works as intended. These technologies act as the end-user.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<h3>4.3 User Documentation</h3>
<p>All pieces of code will be properly documented in order to ensure clarity of the purpose and function of the program. Up to date user documentation will be posted on our projects wiki page, which can be found here: <a href="https://wiki.muspace.me" target="_blank">MuSpace Wiki</a>. All other documents can be found on our project webpage here: <a href="https://muspace.me">MuSpace Documentation</a>.</p>
<h2>5. Money/Cost</h2>
<img src="https://en.meming.world/images/en/0/0d/In_Terms_Of_Money%2C_We_Have_No_Money.jpg" width="256" alt="Meme from Despicable Me movie: In terms of money, we have no money" />
<p>This project is solely dependent on the time and effort of the developers. No monetary funding is collected or needed. All resources (frameworks, APIs, etc.) are free and open-source with the exception of purchasing a one-year domain subscription that was divided equally between all team members. A <i>Spotify Account</i> is required for developing and testing <i>Spotify SDK</i> features.</p>
